<p><em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is simply dummy <strong>text</strong> of the printing and typesetting industry.<br/>
 Lorem Ipsum has been <i>the industry's standard</i> dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br/>
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br/><hr/>
  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br/> 
  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently<br/>
   with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
